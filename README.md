Hi, I’m Jack Kirby

I recently graduated as a Master in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Warwick. Alongside my formal education, since 2014 I have been developing my programming skills. 

Beginning with a Caesar shift encoder and decoder in QB64, I have progressed to many other languages to achieve my personal projects including Python, Java, C++, Rust, HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

For more information about me, check out my [portfolio page](https://jackrekirby.github.io/Portfolio/).

If you wish to contact me, my email is [jackrekirby@gmail.com](mailto:jackrekirby@gmail.com).
