Hi I’m Jack Kirby,

I have been a software engineer at Aurora Energy Research in Oxford since Autumn 2022.

I graduated with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Warwick in 2022. Alongside my formal education, since 2013 I have been developing my programming skills.

Beginning with a Caesar shift encoder and decoder in QB64, I have progressed to many other languages to achieve my personal projects including Python, Java, C++, Rust, Go, HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
